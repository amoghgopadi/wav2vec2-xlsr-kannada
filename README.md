# wav2vec2-xlsr-kannada

Wav2Vec2 is a pretrained model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). This notebook has an in-detail explanation of how XLSR-Wav2Vec2's pretrained checkpoint can be fine-tuned on a low-resource ASR dataset of any language. For demonstration purposes, I have fine-tuned the wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53 on the low resource Kannada ASR multi-speaker dataset of OpenSLR.
